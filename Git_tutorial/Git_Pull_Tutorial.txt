Git push tutorial :

Remote Repository -----> (Fetch)----> Origin/Master -------> Merge ----> Project

This whole process is called Pull

* Git pull is used to fetch and merge changes from the remote repository to the 
local repository.

* Git pull is a combination of two commands, git fetch followed by git merge. 

git fetch : Git fetch command downloads content from the required remote repository.
git merge : Git merge command combines multiple sequences of commits into a single branch.

----------------------- Let's do this with commands ------------------

1. mkdir git_back	# make a directory
2. cd git_back		# go to in this directory
3. mkdir Changes	# make a directory
4. cd Changes		# go to this directory

5. git init		# Initialize local git repository (.git folder created)

Let's pull the directory 'Git_tutorial' from the 'Git_Tutorial' repository 

* Before pull command, copy the HTTPS URL from the 'Git-Tutorial' repository
which looks like - https://github.com/Chetansoni123/Git_Tutorial.git

6. git pull https://github.com/Chetansoni123/Git_Tutorial.git

Now, we got our 2 files i.e. 'Git_Push_tutorial.txt' and 'Git_Pull_tutorial.txt'.

Let's make some changes or add some content in 'Git_Pull_tutorial.txt' file and 
then we push back this file into the github(or 'Git-Tutorial folder) again.

7. git add Git_tutorial/Git_Pull_Tutorial.txt

- This commands adds this file 

8- git status # check this file appears here

9. git commit -m "git-pull"
- Make commit of this file

10. git status # check status again

hence, changes are made now, we will push this 'Git_Pull_Tutorial.txt' file
into the 'Git-Tutorial' repository.

* Before push, copy HTTPs URL from this 'Git_Tutorial' repository which looks
like : https://github.com/Chetansoni123/Git_Tutorial.git

11. git remote add origin https://github.com/Chetansoni123/Git_Tutorial.git

12. git remote -v 
- You can see fetch and push commands in order.

13. git push origin master

Now, we can see our file 'Git_Pull_tutorial.txt' has been pushed into the 'Git-Tutorial'
repository.
